    // start with numbers, strings and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;//reference
    console.log(age,age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age,age2);//age2 is not getting update because age value goes into the variable at the same time
    let name = 'wes';
    let name2 = name;//reference
    console.log(name,name2);
    name = 'Edison';
    console.log(name,name2);
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;//reference
    console.log(players,team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this: About "reference" arrays behave different than numbers, strings and booleans
    // arrays always reference back.
    team[3] = 'Lux';//'team' & 'players' are updated replacing index=3 'Poppy' with 'Lux' because 'team' is a reference of 'players'.
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();// slice without arg makes a 'copy' then the original array won't get updated by if it's updated.
    // one way
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players); // concat also makes a 'copy' then the original array won't get updated by if it's updated.
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; 
    team4[3] = 'heeee haaa';
    console.log(players, team4);
    const team5 = Array.from(players); 
    team5[3] = 'heeee haa';
    console.log(players, team5);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects behave the same as arrays, make a 'copy' then the original object won't get updated by if it's updated.
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 88});
    console.log(captain, captain2);
    const captain3 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 88, age: 12});
    console.log(captain, captain3);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain4 = {...person}
    console.log(captain, captain4);
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
          twitter: '@wesbos',
          facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }
    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    console.log(wes, dev);
